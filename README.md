# Facies Classification Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict facies types from well log data. We utilize a dataset derived from a class exercise from The University of Kansas, focusing on the Hugoton and Panoma Fields. This dataset includes well log data from nine wells, labeled with facies types based on core observations.

## Background
Facies classification is crucial for understanding reservoir properties and enhancing hydrocarbon exploration and production. The dataset for this project is based on contributions from Bohling and Dubois (2003) and Dubois et al. (2007). We employ machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, to automate the classification of facies from well log data.
